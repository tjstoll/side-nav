# side-nav
A JavaScript module that builds the side navigation content based on the sections of a one page html document. It assumes only the sections and their corresponding subsections for now.

## Structuring The HTML
The following are important class names that will be used when structuring the HTML  
`sideNav` is where all the side navigation parts go  
`content` is where all the sections go  
`section` is where all the titles and associated content goes  
`sectionTitle` specifies a section title  
`subSectionTitle` specifies a subsection title  

>**__Important!__**
>1. Make sure to include the appropriate class names on each of the elements or else there will be chaos...
>2. Elements with class names `sectionTitle` or `subSectionTitle` must have an `id` tag with the name of the section or some abbreviation thereof. The id tag will reference the section to jump to when clicked in the side navigation.
>3. For now, `section` cannot be nested in another `section` or else there will be more chaos...

Somewhere in your HTML document you should have the following structure:

```html
<div class='sideNav'>
  <!--
  Optional div containing title, search bar, etc.
  -->
</div>

<div class='content'>
  <div class='section'>
    <h2 id='name-of-section' class='sectionTitle'>Name of Section</h2>
    <h3 id='name-of-subsection' class='subSectionTitle'>Name of Subsection</h3>
  </div>
</div>
```

See the [sample index.html](https://github.com/tjstoll/side-nav/blob/master/index.html) for an example.

## The CSS
The basic CSS for the side navigation and the content (along with some extra example specific styling) can be found in [style.css](https://github.com/tjstoll/side-nav/blob/master/style.css). Feel free to go wild with all your own styles!

## JavaScript Generated List Sections
Import class names generated by [the JavaScript](https://github.com/tjstoll/side-nav/blob/master/script.js):  
`sn-listSection` specifies a complete side navigation item  
`sn-buttons` specifies a group of buttons in the list section (or sublist)  
`sn-btn2` specifies the button to control the toggling of the sublist  
`sn-btn1` specifies the button with the section title  
`sublist` specifies the sublist of buttons for the subsections  

For each `section` in `content` the JavaScript will have appended to `sideNav` the following sort of HTML block:

```html
<div class='sn-listSection'>
  <div class='sn-buttons'>
    <button class='sn-btn2' onclick='...'>...</button>
    <button class='sn-btn1' onclick='...'>...</button>
  </div>
  <div class='sn-sublist'>
    <div class='sn-buttons'>...</div>
    <div class='sn-buttons'>...</div>
    ...
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

>**Note:**
>- `sn-btn2` is disabled for sections with no subsection
>- divisions with class `sublist` are not created for list items corresponding to sections with no subsection
